# Trading Simulator

The Trading Simulator is a C++ project designed to provide users with a realistic trading environment to practice and develop their trading strategies without any financial risk.

## **Introduction**

The Trading Simulator allows users to explore various trading strategies through three algorithms: a random trading algorithm, a Bollinger Bands strategy, and a Reverse Mean strategy. This project aims to help traders refine their skills and understand market dynamics in a simulated setting.

## **Installation**

To install the Trading Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaoudAA/TradingSimulator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd TradingSimulator
3. Compile the project:
    ```bash   
    g++ -o TradingSimulator main.cpp
## **Usage**
To use the Trading Simulator, follow these steps:
Run the simulator from the command line:
  
    ./TradingSimulator

## **Algorithms**
The Trading Simulator includes three trading algorithms:

+ Random Trading Algorithm: Executes trades based on random decisions, serving as a baseline for comparison.
+ Bollinger Bands Strategy: Utilizes Bollinger Bands to identify potential buy and sell signals based on market volatility.
+ Reverse Mean Strategy: Applies a mean reversion approach to capitalize on price fluctuations around a statistical mean.
